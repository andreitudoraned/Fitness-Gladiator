					    	<p>
                            One reason for the high rate of success at Gladiator Fitness
					    	is the high level of intensity.What this entails is being
					    	able to train for upto 30 minutes non-stop. This is achieved
					    	due to the high numbers of state of the are equipment, the
					    	abundancy of these equipment and there relative distance
					    	from one another which allows you to move from machine to
					    	machine not needing to wait on anybody else an also your
					    	next machine is relatively close thus saving time.</p>

                            <p>TRX Suspension Training requires only two adjustable bands to workout every single musncle in your body. TRX workouts do not only improve your muscle strength but also your cardiovascular endurance. This type of workout is also low impact which means joints are not put under much stress which results in very low risk of injury.</p>
